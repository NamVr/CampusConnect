# CampusConnect AI

## Project Overview

CampusConnect AI is an innovative application designed to bridge the gap between students and campus events, opportunities, and information using the power of AI. It provides a personalized and intuitive experience for students to discover relevant events, connect with collaborators, and get quick answers to their campus-related questions.
